"""Logistic Distribution is used to describe growth.

Used extensively in machine learning in logistic regression, neural networks etc.

It has three parameters:

loc - mean, where the peak is. Default 0.

scale - standard deviation, the flatness of distribution. Default 1.

size - The shape of the returned array.

The code and its functionality revolve around visualizing the **logistic distribution** and understanding how data behaves. Here's a detailed explanation of its **use cases**:

---

### **1. Understanding Distributions**
The code helps to visualize the **logistic distribution** of data:
- **Logistic distribution**: A bell-shaped curve that represents data with most values clustering around the mean.

**Use Case**:
- Identify whether your dataset follows a logistic distribution.
- Spot deviations, such as skewness or outliers.

### **2. Financial Analysis**
- **Logistic Distribution**: It is used to describe the growth of a company's market value over time.   
- **Logistic Distribution**: It is used to model the probability of success in a series of Bernoulli trials, where each trial has a fixed probability of success.
- **Logistic Distribution**: It is used to model the probability of success in a series of Bernoulli trials, where each trial has a fixed probability of success.   """
